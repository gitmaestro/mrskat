Repository for my personal website

I'm getting into jekyll and trying to make my own template from scratch (default theme).
When everything is done and I'm satisfied with it, it will go online.

Right now it is **under major construction** so nevermind the mess.

See 'todo.md' file for detailed todo list.

P.S. I mix russian and english all together.
